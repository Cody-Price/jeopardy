# JEOPARDY!
Jeopardy! is a three-player trivia game based on the iconic television show. The gameboard shows 4 categories with 5 questions pertaining to each category. As the dollar amount increases, so does the difficulty. 

If your answer is correct, you win the dollar amount. Guess incorrectly, and your score decreases by the dollar amount. If you find a daily double, you're able to wager any dollar amount up to your current score. In round two, each dollar amount in doubled. Round three is final jeopardy. Each player will have 30 seconds to answer the question and wager a dollar amount up to his or her current score. The player with the highest score wins!
